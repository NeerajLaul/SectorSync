# Methodology-Aware Benchmark - Quick Start

## 🚀 In 30 Seconds

**What it does:** Shows you benchmarks that adapt to your recommended methodology.

**Key insight:** Different methodologies care about different metrics. This page only shows what matters for *your* methodology.

## 📊 The Basics

### 3 Comparisons
1. **Cohort Avg (Blue)** - Teams like yours (based on your answers)
2. **Industry Avg (Green)** - Your industry peers
3. **Company Exemplar (Orange)** - Real company using your methodology

### 6 Pillars
- 🌊 **Flow** - How work moves
- ✅ **Quality** - How well work is done
- 📅 **Predictability** - How reliably commitments are met
- 💎 **Value** - How quickly value reaches customers
- 😊 **Customer** - How satisfied customers are
- 🚫 **Waste** - How much non-value time exists

### 16 Metrics (filtered to ~10-15 for your methodology)
You only see metrics with high relevance for your methodology.

## 🎯 Quick Actions

### If You're Below Industry Average
1. Pick **1-2 metrics** to improve
2. Read the metric description and ideal trend
3. Focus on metrics in high-emphasis pillars (see radar chart)
4. Apply tips from the guide

### If You're At/Above Industry Average
1. Celebrate! You're competitive
2. Look at exemplar companies for next-level insights
3. Consider which pillar to push further
4. Track trends over time (retake quarterly)

## 🏆 Methodology Examples

### You Got: Scrum
**What you'll see:**
- Cycle Time, Lead Time, Throughput ✅
- Escapes, Rework, First Pass Yield ✅
- Plan Reliability ✅
- Time-to-Value, Business Value ✅
- **NOT** SPI/CPI (not relevant for iterative work)

**Exemplar:** Spotify
**Focus:** Flow and Value delivery

---

### You Got: Waterfall
**What you'll see:**
- SPI, CPI, Plan Reliability ✅
- Escapes, Rework, First Pass Yield ✅
- Lead Time (long cycles expected) ✅
- **NOT** Cycle Time, Flow Efficiency (sequential phases)

**Exemplar:** Boeing
**Focus:** Predictability and Quality

---

### You Got: Continuous Delivery
**What you'll see:**
- Cycle Time, Lead Time, Throughput ✅
- Batch Size, Queue/Wait Ratio ✅
- Time-to-Value ✅
- **NOT** SPI/CPI (continuous flow, not planned iterations)

**Exemplar:** Amazon
**Focus:** Flow and Waste reduction

## 📈 Reading the Charts

### Bar Chart
- **Left side:** Metric names
- **Bars:** Longer = higher value
- **Lower is better:** Cycle Time, Lead Time, Escapes, Rework, Wait Ratio, Batch Size
- **Higher is better:** Throughput, Flow Efficiency, Plan Reliability, Time-to-Value, Business Value, NPS, SLA

### Radar Chart
- **Larger area:** More important for your methodology
- **Smaller area:** Less important
- **Use this to prioritize** which pillars to focus on

## 🎓 Your Cohort

### "Large, Regulated, Up-Front Planning"
**Profile:** Big projects, high compliance, predictability focus
**Strengths:** Very stable, low escapes, high plan reliability
**Trade-offs:** Longer cycle times

### "Product Teams Optimizing for Speed" ⭐ Most Common
**Profile:** Medium projects, iterative, speed focus
**Strengths:** Balanced cycle time, good throughput
**Trade-offs:** Moderate escapes

### "Startup-like Innovation"
**Profile:** Small projects, low compliance, innovation focus
**Strengths:** Fastest cycle time, high throughput
**Trade-offs:** Higher escapes (acceptable risk)

## 🏢 Industries

- Plan Reliability: 90%

## 💡 Top 3 Tips

### 1. Start with High-Emphasis Pillars
Look at the radar chart. Focus improvement on pillars with large areas first.

### 2. Pick Low-Hanging Fruit
Find metrics where you're furthest below industry average. These are your quick wins.

### 3. Learn from Exemplars
Click the source links for exemplar companies. Read their blog posts and case studies.

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. **Take action** - Pick 1 metric to improve this quarter
2. **Track progress** - Retake assessment in 3 months
3. **Read guide** - See `/METHODOLOGY-AWARE-BENCHMARK-GUIDE.md` for detailed explanations
4. **Share insights** - Discuss benchmarks with your team

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Why don't I see all 16 metrics?**  
A: You only see metrics relevant to your methodology (relevance ≥ 0.55).

**Q: What's my cohort?**  
A: Based on your answers about size, planning, compliance, sourcing, and goals.

**Q: Can I change the exemplar company?**  
A: No, each methodology has 1 exemplar. Different methodology = different exemplar.

**Q: Why is there no numeric data for the exemplar?**  
A: Many companies don't publish detailed metrics. We show their approach and source links instead.

**Q: How do I improve?**  
A: Focus on metrics in high-emphasis pillars where you're below industry average. See the guide for specific tips.
